# WHY TEACH OUR CHILDREN?
## WE ARE COMMANDED TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN

Meet our Sunday School Leaders.  

Debra Jallim is the leader of our lovely Kidz Connect program for children ages 6-11 years.  This group of excited and passionate kids meet each Sunday at 5:00 PM during our Sunday service. 

God commanded us to teach our children diligently that is to make every effort to encourage and enable them to walk in the ways of the Lord. Living Hope Community's mandate is to work alongside parents to help equip and teach their children to be rooted and grounded in God's word and to see them grow in faith. We believe imparting God's word at an early age builds the foundation for our children to continue walking in the ways of the Lord and not to depart from the faith.

Dr. RC Sproul said it best "I don’t think there’s a mandate to be found in sacred Scripture that is more solemn than this one. That we are to teach our children the truth of God’s Word is a sacred, holy responsibility that God gives to His people. And it’s not something that is to be done only one day a week in Sunday school. We can’t abdicate the responsibility to the church. The primary responsibility for the education of children according to Scripture is the family, the parents. And what is commanded is the passing on of tradition." Dr. RC Sproul

# OUR FOCUS AND VALUES

## CREATIVITY
We believe in teaching our children to be creative. Creativity sparks imagination and our focus is to help our children know about God at an early age. 


## TEACH
Every Sunday we encourage our younger ones to show and display what they have learned, we incorporate hands-on activities, singing and memorizing scripture passages as part of our teaching process. 


## GROWTH
Our desire is to see our younger ones grow in faith at an early age. Our curriculum is geared for every age group. We believe every child is special in the eyes of the Lord and our focus is to work together to encourage learning at all ages. The family that learns together grows together.
