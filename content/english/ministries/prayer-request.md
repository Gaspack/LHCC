THE NEED FOR PRAYER
WHY PRAY?

As a community, we are called to seek the Lord  for one another and to stand in the gap for each other.  God promised to hear our prayers and heal our land, heal broken hearts and lives, heal broken relationships, heal sickness and disease, change and transform lives and bring hope to the hopeless and peace to the trouble hearts.
