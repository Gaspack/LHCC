# JOIN US ON WEDNESDAY AT 7:30 PM (WEEKLY)

Hello, My name is Debra Jallim, and I am the leader of the Women's Coffee Chat Group. We meet weekly on Wednesdays at 7:30 PM.  

As women of God, we play a key role in the lives of our families. Our goal is to encourage each other in our walk and relationship with Christ. Most importantly we challenge each other to support our husbands and families in their journey with the Lord. As women are called by God to stand alongside each other, both physically and spiritually to fulfill our mandate as image-bearers of Christ, striving to raise godly families. We need more women of faith to rise up as women of God and fulfill our mandate as godly women.
