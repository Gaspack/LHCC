As people of God, we are called to worship the Lord as a community of believers, lifting holy hands and praising God as an expression of our worship. The Apostle Paul said, "I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16).  As followers, we too are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which must be preached to all people everywhere.  It is through the preaching of the gospel, that we see the demonstration of God's power to change and transform lives. 

> <span class="teaser">"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;  the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.” 20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."</span><cite>1 Corinthians 1:18-25</cite>
