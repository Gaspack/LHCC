# WHY LIFE GROUP?
Life Group helps families of all ages to engage weekly to interact and study God's word. This allows us to grow in our faith and walk with the Lord. Each week we dig deeper and deeper into God's word as the Holy Spirit leads.  We are also given an opportunity to interact with each other, ask questions and split out into smaller groups to discuss the topic at hand. Everyone is encouraged to contribute because we believe in learning and growing together. 


# MAKING DISCIPLES
We believe in the great commission "Go into all the world  and make disciples" Matt. 28:19-20. 

We also believe in studying God's word as found in
