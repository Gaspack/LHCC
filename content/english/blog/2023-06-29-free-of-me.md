title: "FREE OF ME - SHARON HODDE MILLER"
subheadline: "Completed"
teaser: "We live in a culture that's all about self, becoming the best “me” I can be instead of becoming like Jesus. This me-centered message affects every area of our lives—our friendships, families, self-image, even our faith—and it negatively impacts each one. The self-focused life robs our joy, shrinks our souls, and is the reason we never quite break free of insecurity."
