OUR MISSION

# LOVE

Love others - Living Hope Community Church
To Love for God and all People.

As believers, we are called to love God and our neighbour as ourselves (Matt22:36-40). Our goal is to be a missional church. As such, we seek to reach people with the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ and join him in building his kingdom here on earth. We seek to do this by engaging in and transforming people’s lives.

 We believe in the great commission to "Go in all the world preach the gospel" Matt 28:18-20

# GROW

To Grow in the knowledge of Christ and our relationship with each other. 

We are passionate about teaching and equipping disciples to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and releasing them into areas where God has called them to serve. "Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." John 17: 3  

"This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples." (John 15:8)

 "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." Acts 1:8

# TEACH

To Teach God's people to be missional in our communities at large in obedience to the Great Commission 

 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." Matt 28:19-20

Teaching is critical in discipleship making as followers of Jesus. This is more than just another Bible study program, it is about living our lives daily in relationship with Christ for others to see. We are imitators of Christ.

# SERVE

To Serve is to be the hands and feet of Jesus. 

We believe that community involvement and engagement is the heart-beat of God.  "For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me." Matt 25:35-36

Jesus called us to go into all the world and make disciples and to serve our community and the world at large as we live our lives as his followers.  Serving our communities is the work of passionate disciples who know the heart-beat of God and want to be the hands and feet of Jesus. That is why we are passionate about partnering with other local support groups in reaching out to those in need.
