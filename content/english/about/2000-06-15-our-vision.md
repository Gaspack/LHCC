We believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ is for all people everywhere, not just for a particular color or group of people but for those whom the Lord God will call to faith. We are a multi-ethnic, multiple-cultural and multi-generation church that seeks to be a missional church by reviving our community through making discipleship for Christ.

All our programs are geared towards integrating the entire family to worship, learn and grow together.  Our Sunday evening worship service focuses on all to engage in worshipping the Lord. Family worship is important to us. Our Kidz 4 Christ programs seek to engage, teach and equip parents to play a major role in the lives of their child/children's growth in the Lord. Our Men's Fellowship is to encourage men of faith to walk daily in their relationship with Christ and to lead their family as the spiritual head of their household.
